# Change log

Append-only, chronological (oldest at the top, newest at the bottom). One entry
per operation that adds, removes, or substantially edits wiki pages. Format:

```text
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] <operation> | <subject>
```

Get the timestamp with `date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"` rather than guessing. Operations:
`generate-paper-summary`, `add-concept`, `query`, `lint`, `reconcile`, `setup`.
Body: 2-5 sentences on what was done, plus the model used (for traceability,
since exact reproduction is not possible — see AGENTS.md).

## [2026-06-09 00:00] setup | wiki scaffold created

Initialized the CS858 wiki structure: `wiki/papers/`, `wiki/concepts/`, index
and log files, the `/generate-paper-summary` workflow, and supporting scripts
copied and adapted from the research-wiki. No paper or concept pages yet.
